## Product Description

The GOAT gives the enemy something to think about â€“ they can no longer employ traditional tactics when faced with the GOAT. This unique weaponry will force them to reconsider their grasp on reality, putting the odds in your favor. It is best in class for dismounted troops in all environments and terrain - providing the power of livestock when you need it most.

Extremely flexible, the GOAT can attack from almost any position, from up high in a building to behind a tree or a cliff face. You can fire down 45 degrees and can shoot from inside a building, from a basement or from the second floor of a barn - out of the range of most tanks.

The GOAT will keep the enemy on their toes through deception. Thinking they are being approached by mere livestock, they will not attempt to evade and will become subject to the destructive force of the GOAT.
